    I am a full stack web developer with a passion for learning and keeping up
    with the latest technologies. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript, as well as experience with backend server-side technologies such
    as Node.js, Vanilla Node, PHP, and Express.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am proficient in both SQL and NoSQL databases and have a good
    understanding of Webpack. Additionally, I am experienced with React and
    React Hooks and have a solid understanding of HTTP protocols.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also dabbled in Java and Python and have enjoyed learning software
    dev. Java really contributed to what I have learnt of object oriented
    programming.

  <p>
    One of my greatest strengths is my ability to adapt and learn new
    technologies as they emerge. I enjoy staying up to date with current trends
    in the industry and always strive to expand my knowledge and skillset. I am
    excited about the future of web development and what new features it will
    bring!

    When I first created this page, I didn't plan for it to become what it's
    becoming now. However, I have future plans to develop it into a full-stack
    website. For now, it's built using Bootstrap and jQuery.
